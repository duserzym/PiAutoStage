Spring Loaded Carriage

This carriage system was redesigned from the weighted carriage design
	to deal with inconsistent slide sizes. 

User will need a 2mm diamter by 4-6mm long spring and 2 11mm nuts. The spring should be glued
	into the 2mm holes on the carriage and block. Nuts can be glued into the respective positions.
